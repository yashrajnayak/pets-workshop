Create a filtering system for the dogs listing page with the following features:

1. Add two filter controls:
   - A dropdown menu for filtering by dog breed
   - A checkbox for filtering by adoption availability (checked = show only available dogs)

2. Implementation details:
   - Populate the breed dropdown with all unique breeds from the database
   - Include an "All Breeds" option as the default selection
   - Label the checkbox clearly as "Show only available dogs"
   - Position filters at the top of the dogs listing for visibility

3. User experience:
   - Apply filters automatically when changed (no separate "Filter" button needed)
   - Refresh the dogs list immediately when either filter is modified
